## Joven's Tools

This repository contains some Magic-related command-line tools, as well
as a GUI wrapper `main.py` that can host them as independent threads.
It is a major work-in-progress - more details will be added as I work
on each tool!

### Arcane Proxy

This tool uses Scryfall's API to generate easy-to-read proxies.
Currently, this tool only supports the TSP100 receipt printer
on Windows and Linux, but I plan to expand it to create printable
sheets for standard Letter-sized printers.

### Tireless Tracker

 Pardon our dust - This tool is still being built!
